    <h1>A History of Commitment to Distributing</h1>
    <p>Since its inception, Consolidated Electrical Distributors (CED) has focused on meeting its customers' electrical requirements - one customer at a time. Even though CED has one of the nation's largest electrical distribution networks with over 500 locations from coast to coast, CED still does business based on the needs of the individual. That's the way it was when CED began in 1957; and that's the way it will always be. CED's policy of "Service, Integrity, Reliability" is the driving force in every community served.</p>
